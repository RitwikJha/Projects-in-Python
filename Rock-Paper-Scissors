"""This is a game of Rock Paper Scissors between the user and the computer.
The user gives an input, the computer generates it's own input and output
is provided to the user which states 3 possibilities:
1. The user has won the match.
2. The user has lost the match.
3. The match is tied.
It will be a game of 5 matches. Whoever wins more matches will ultimately win the game.
Finally, an output will be displayed who won the game."""
